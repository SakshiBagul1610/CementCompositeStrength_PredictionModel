# CementCompositeStrength_PredictionModel

# MultiVariate Analysis

# Problem Statement :

# Objective :

1. To Predict Cement Composite Strength Based On Independent Columns

# Steps to Build Machine Learning Model

## Step 1 :
Import Basic Scikit Learn Librarirs for Data manipulation as Well Data Visualization.

## Step 2 :
Data Uploading Using Pandas function.

## Step 3 :
Doing Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] : --->
1. Univariate Analysis
2. Bi Variate Analysis

## Step 4 :
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing also Feature Engineering.

## Step 5 :
1. Split Data into Independent & Dependent Column i.e. X and y.
2. Using Train & Test Split to Prevent Data Leakage

## Step 6 : 
1. Model Building Using Scikit Learn Libraries.

## Step 7 :
Save Your Best Model as Pickle File.

## Step 8 :
Deploy the Pickle File Using Streamlit.
